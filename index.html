          Hey there! I am Harmaan üëã. I am an Indian boy who lives in Shenzhen,
          China. My hobby is to play sports, football ‚öΩÔ∏è and cricket üèè . I am
          also interested in math, science, and coding. In coding, I have been
          learning about HTML and CSS for the past 6 months. Over the years, my
          interest for Math and Science is always developing and I am learning
          various things in both subjects. I love to be energetic at all times
          and I never like to sit without doing anything. Whenever there is an
          activity which inclues a ball, my attention gets caught, and all of a
          sudden I am energetic again.

            I have always loved football since the age of 8. I love this sport
            because I think that it is very engaging and it helps me improve my
            collaboration and awreness skills in the real world. I love many
            football teams, however, my favorite is definetely FC Barcelona. My
            favorite player and my football model is Lionel Messi because he
            shows the world that height or any physical disadvantage does not
            matter as long as you want to desperately achieve something.

          <p>
            I have always loved cricket since the age of 5. I love this sport
            because it always helps me to give my mind a focus-time so that my
            body can focus. Another skill that I have developed while playing
            cricket is collabartion skills as we always need to work in a team
            in-order to be successful. I love a lot of teams in the IPL,
            however, my favorite team is Mumbai Indians. My favorite cricket
            player is Virat Kohli because he shows his consistancy and composure
            in almost all of his matches. This shows that practice makes
            perfect.

            Ever since the age of 11, I have always wondered what exactly is
            coding. At that time, I just thought that it was about technology
            and how technologically robots and cars are made. But then, after a
            year, I started to have coding lessons. That's where I learned that
            coding is much more than what I thought, there were so many
            different levels of coding and everyone had their own use. From then
            onwards, I loved coding and it became one of my main interests
            especially because I was able to solve my curiousity.
