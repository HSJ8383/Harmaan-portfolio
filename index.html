    <p class="about-content">Hey there! I am Harmaan 👋. I am Indian boy who lives in Shenzhen, China. My hobby is to play sports, football ⚽️ and cricket 🏏 . I am also interested in math, science, and coding. In coding, I have been learning about HTML and CSS for the past 6 months. Over the years, my interest for Math and scinece is always developing and I am learning various things in both subjects. I love to be energetic at all times and I never like to sit without doing anything. Whichever activity which includes a ball, my attention gets caught and all of a sudden, I end up being energetic again. </p>
