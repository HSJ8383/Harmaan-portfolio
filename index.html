          Hey there! I am Harmaan üëã. I am an Indian boy who lives in Shenzhen,
          China. My hobby is to play sports, football ‚öΩÔ∏è and cricket üèè . I am
          also interested in math, science, and coding. In coding, I have been
          learning about HTML and CSS for the past 6 months. Over the years, my
          interest for Math and Science is always developing and I am learning
          various things in both subjects. I love to be energetic at all times
          and I never like to sit without doing anything. Whichever activity
          which includes a ball, my attention gets caught and all of a sudden, I
          end up being energetic again.

          <p>
            I have always loved football since the age of 8. I love this sport
            because I think that it is very engaging and it helps me improve my
            collaboration and awreness skills in the real world. I love many
            football teams, however, my favorite is definetely FC Barcelona. My
            favorite player and my football model is Messi because he shows the
            world that height or any physical disadvantage does not matter as
            long as you want to desperately achieve something.
